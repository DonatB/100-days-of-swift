## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/30/7/wrap-up):
>1. Go through project 30 and remove all the force unwraps. Note: implicitly unwrapped optionals are not the same thing as force unwraps – you’re welcome to fix the implicitly unwrapped optionals too, but that’s a bonus task.
>2. [Challenge 2](../60-Project30-Challenge2)
>3. For a tougher challenge, take the image generation code out of cellForRowAt: generate all images when the app first launches, and use those smaller versions instead. For bonus points, combine the getDocumentsDirectory() method I introduced in project 10 so that you save the resulting cache to make sure it never happens again.
